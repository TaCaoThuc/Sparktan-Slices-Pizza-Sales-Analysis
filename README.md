## Introduction
### Scenario: 
You are a Data Analyst working Spartan Slices Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in Florida, USA. You've been hired to help the restaurant make things work better using data. The manager welcomed you and mentioned that things are alright at Spartan Slices, but there's room for improvement. They've been collecting transaction data for a year, but haven't really been able to use it well. They hope you can analyze the data to help them find ways to increase sales and work more efficiently.

### KPIs that should be identified:
-	Total Revenue
-	Average Order Value
-	Total Pizzas Sold
-	Total Orders
-	Average Pizzas per Order
Other metrics that need to be explored: 
-	Daily and monthly trend for total orders 
-	Percentage of sales for pizza category and size
-	Total pizzas sold by category
-	Top 5 best/ worst sellers by revenue, quantity, and number of orders.

### This dataset provides 12 important characteristics regarding pizza sales:
- order_id: An unique identifier for each order made at a table.
- order_details_id: A unique identifier for each pizza within an order (pizzas of the same type and size are grouped together, and the quantity increases).
- pizza_id: A distinct key identifier linking the ordered pizza to its specifics, such as size and price.
- quantity: The number of pizzas ordered of the same type and size.
- order_date: The date when the order was placed (noted before cooking and serving).
- order_time: The time when the order was placed (noted before cooking and serving).
- unit_price: The cost of the pizza in USD.
- total_price: Calculated by multiplying the unit_price by the quantity.
- pizza_size: The size classification of the pizza (Small, Medium, Large, X Large, or XX Large).
- pizza_type: A distinct identifier connecting the pizza order to its attributes, like size and price.
- pizza_ingredients: The ingredients used in the pizza as displayed on the menu (all variations include Mozzarella Cheese, unless not specified; and all include Tomato Sauce, except if another sauce is stated).
- pizza_name: The title of the pizza as presented on the menu.

## Recommendations

Based on above findings, some recommendations can be made for the restaurant's manager:

-	As Thursday, Friday and Saturday have the highest order volumes, additional staff and resources should be allocated to handle the increased demand on these days, especially Friday. As Sunday and Monday have lower orders, the restaurant can introduce promotions to encourage more sales on these days.

-	The manager should adjust inventory levels and ingredient purchases based on the monthly trend for total orders. During peak months like July and May, inventory should be scaled up, and during off-peak months like October and September, a more conservative approach is advisable. Additionally, conducting further investigations to understand the reasons behind specific months' order fluctuations can lead to more effective strategies.

-	With regards to categories, as Class and Supreme have higher demand and contribute more to total revenue, the manager should consider running more promotions or marketing strategies to maintain their popularity. It is also advisable to introduce more items or variations within these categories. Moreover, attention should still be paid to Veggie and Chicken. Although they have lower demand and contribute less to total revenue, their contributions are still significant and strategies should be developed to optimize their sales.

-	Best sellers like Thai Chicken Pizza and Classic Deluxe Pizza, with L size, should be further promoted by marketing campaigns and pricing strategies so that the restaurant can capitalize on customersâ€™ love for them.

-	For worst sellers like Brie Carre Pizza, Spinach Supreme Pizza and Mediterranean Pizza, it is advised to further analyze why they are low in demand, considering their recipes, prices, and local preferences. After that, actions like modifications of these pizzas or removals of them from the menu can be made.
